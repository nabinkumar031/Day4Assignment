Given 3 Integers find the maximum

- Ensure to test code with the Test Case.
- To ensure your Code works you need 3 test cases with Max Number at 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- Use Integer Object and compareTo UC 1 method to test the maximum number


        Given Max Number at 1st Position return the Same Number

        Ensure the test data has Max Number in the First position

        Given Max Number at 2nd Position return the Same Number

        Ensure the test data has Max Number in the Second position

        Given Max Number at 3rd Position return the Same Number

        Ensure the test data has Max Number in the Third position

Given 3 Floats find the maximum

- Ensure to test code with the Test Case and
repeat with the similar 3 Test cases in UC 1

Given 3 Strings find the maximum

- Ensure to test code with the Test Case and repeat with the similar 3 Test cases in UC 1

Refactor 1 - Refactor all the 3 to One Generic Method and find the maximum
          Ensure the Generic Type extends Comparable  Make the test case work
